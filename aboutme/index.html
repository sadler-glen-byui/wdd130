    <p>Kia ora everyone</p>
    <p>
      My name is Glen Sadler and I'm a kiwi from down-under. So I live in New
      Zealand. I'm married to Gail and we have 6 children; 1 Girl and 5 Boys,
      all who are grown and flown the coup. I'm a Grand-Dad with 7 beautiful
      grandchildren whom we love and cherish with all our hearts.

    <p>
      I've just transferred my degree from a CIT Major to a Software Development
      Major as the catalog number for CIT is expiring next year. I'm looking
      forward to working with you all.

    <p>
      I've opted to take CSE-110 and CSE-111 concurrently so I hope this doesn't
      get too hectic. I enjoy programming and Web development and hope to
      increase my knowledge in programming with Python.
